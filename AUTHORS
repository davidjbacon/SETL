GNU SETL authors
----------------

David Bacon (dB)  <David.Bacon@nyu.edu>  https://setl.org/


Other authors
-------------

The GNU SETL preprocessor (sources in src/cpp/) was derived from the
version of the GNU C Preprocessor in cpp-2.7.2.1.tgz.  Although there
is no AUTHORS file in that tarball, comments in the source code
indicate authorship by Paul Rubin, Richard Stallman, and Per Bothner.

The authors of the GNU MP distribution in gmp-6.1.2.tgz (or successor)
upon which GNU SETL's large-integer support is based are listed in the
gmp archive's AUTHORS files.

The authors of freeglut (see freeglut-2.0.1.tgz for the original
package) are listed in src/run/freeglut-setl/AUTHORS.
