Aboot GNU SETL
--------------

GNU SETL is an implementation of the SETL language, with some extensions.

To build and install it, see INSTALL.  Or just skip straight to "make".

The top-level folder containing this README is not itself guaranteed to
follow GNU conventions fully, but is intended mainly to drive the src/
and doc/ subdirs, which do.


Further Reading
---------------

The GNU SETL home page is under http://setl.org/.

After local installation of GNU SETL on your system, the commands
"setl --help", "man setl", and "info setl" should be informative in
varying degrees, and .html and .pdf documents should appear in a
folder such as /usr/local/share/doc/setl/.  Briefly, the .info,
.html, and .pdf documents (all of which are generated from a common
Texinfo source) comprise the following:

 - GNU SETL OM - a good place to start

 - Tutorial - a gentle introduction to the SETL language [stub]

 - User Guide - full command and environment variable details

 - Language Reference - a detailed specification of SETL and GNU SETL [stub]

 - Library Reference - details of all the built-in functions and operators

 - Implementation Notes - on occult interfaces and rules [stub]

 - Extension Guide - customizing GNU SETL with new intrinsic functions [stub]

 - Maintenance Manual - notes on the build/distribution system [stub]
