<title>GNU SETL Documentation</title>

<h2>GNU SETL Manuals</h2>

<p>
The <a href="setl.html"><i>GNU SETL Om</i></a>
gives a brief overview of SETL and GNU SETL, and a few words on
what inspired the World's Most Wonderful Programming Language in
the first place.  It also gives links to the other manuals,
and to various external SETL resources.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>setl</tt> command and relatives are partly self-describing
through the <tt>--help</tt> and <tt>--version</tt> options.
For full details, please see the
<a href="setl-user.html"><i>GNU SETL User Guide</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
The main GNU SETL guide currently is the
<a href="setl-lib.html"><i>GNU SETL Library Reference</i></a>,
which describes all the built-in operators and functions.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="pdf.zip">PDF versions of the manuals</a> are meant
for downloading and unpacking into a new folder, whereupon the
cross-reference links among them allow easy local navigation with a
PDF reader.
</p>
<!-- There is also info.zip, with the *.info files, but typical
Info users are far more likely to want those files only where a
"make install" puts them. -->

<p>
The latest GNU SETL releases, including documentation, are at the
<a href="https://setl.org/setl/">GNU SETL web site</a>.
