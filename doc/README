Free software (c) dB - see file COPYING for license (GPL).

This file is part of GNU SETL.


All the usual "make" requests for configuring, building, checking,
installing, cleaning, and distributing GNU SETL can be done from the
top build dir, including many "doc"-specific ones (see ../main.mk).

You can also go into doc in the build tree and use the Makefile
created there by config.  You might do this to rebuild specific files
when you are working on the documentation, for example.

See also ../README and ../INSTALL.

INSTALL (here) is an automatically planted generic default.

If you publish a new version of GNU SETL, please remember to update
../VERSION_NUMBER, and check that you can still do a "make distcheck"
from the top build dir.  Thanks!
