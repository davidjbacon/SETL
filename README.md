# GNU SETL - an extension and implementation of SETL

SETL is a high-level programming language based on sets and
especially mappings.  GNU SETL is an implementation of
that language with some extensions.

This repository is initially a clone of the GNU SETL release
distribution at <https://setl.org/setl/>.

The intention is to update that distribution from time to time
to accord with what is here.
