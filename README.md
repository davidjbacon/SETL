# GNU SETL - an extension and implementation of SETL

SETL is a high-level programming language based on sets, especially
mappings.  GNU SETL is an implementation of that language, with some
extensions.

This GitHub repository, which hosts development between GNU SETL
releases, is based on a distribution at <https://setl.org/setl/>.
That distribution archive is copied here as setl-X.Y.Z.tgz.

It is recommended to install GNU SETL from such an archive, rather
than from a clone of this repo, unless you don't mind the loss of file
timestamps that attends git clone (which causes unnecessary flutter
with automake, needlessly repeated operations during builds, etc.).
