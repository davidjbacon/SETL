Free software (c) dB - see file COPYING for license (GPL).

This file is part of GNU SETL.


All the usual "make" requests for configuring, building, checking,
installing, cleaning, and distributing GNU SETL can be done from the
top build dir, including many "src"-specific ones (see ../main.mk).

You can also go into src and below in the build tree and use the
Makefiles created by config.  You might do this for local rebuilds
during code development.

See also ../README and ../INSTALL.

INSTALL (here) is an automatically planted generic default.

If you publish a new version of GNU SETL, please remember to update
../VERSION_NUMBER, and check that you can still do a "make distcheck"
from the top build dir.  Thanks!
