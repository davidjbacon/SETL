This dirty great hack generates a GLUT/Mesa customization package,
given an appropriate <GL/freeglut.h> and libglut already installed.

*** Update:  A FreeGLUT implementation (see src/run/freeglut-setl/) is
now included with GNU SETL and built automatically.  The name mesa for
this package is now inappropriate, as the OpenGL support is now just
whatever your system provides (be it Mesa or otherwise).  Probably it
should be freeglut.


As a sanity check,

  make gears-demo

in the build directory corresponding to this one ({build}/src/opt/mesa/)
should give a demo familiar to GLUT users.

Alternatively, if a setl interpreter customized with this package is
already installed, the command

  setl -I{build}/src/opt/mesa/ gears.setl

or

  SETL_INCLUDE_PATH={build}/src/opt/mesa/ setl gears.setl

when executed in this directory should do the same thing.

Note that gears.setl has an #include of "custom.setl", which would
normally be better renamed and moved to some standardish location for
SETL #include files.


The collation of scripts and programs that comprise this customization
package generator evolved in part from previous hacks, so things are
far from being as direct or elegant as they could be.

The essential approach to the generation of the required custom.* files
into {build}/src/opt/mesa/ is to apply the C preprocessor to

  #include <GL/freeglut.h>
  #include "auxi.h"

and then munge the output to extract such things as typedefs, #defines,
and function prototypes.  These are collected into the file "tuples",
which is then fed into gen.setl to produce the custom.* files.

Apart from custom.setl, which is meant for user programs to #include,
the custom.* files are automatically collected by mechanisms above the
level of this directory, and incorporated into the GNU SETL translator
and run-time where they are needed.


It may someday be worth looking at whether something like SWIG would
make this all easier and better disciplined.
