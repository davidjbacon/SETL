Subdirectories here contain optional "customization" packages and
their generators.  These customizations extend the GNU SETL
"library" with new operations.

The GNU SETL system is distributed with the generated packages,
much as "configure" scripts are generated by the maintainer using
specialized tools.  Some of the packages, in order to be rebuilt
from scratch, require at least a basic (uncustomized) SETL
installation to be present already.

Each SETL customization package P consists of the following files:

  Name                          Description
  ----                          -----------
  P/custom.lexicon              extends ../lexicon
  P/custom.sysrots              extends ../sysrots
  P/custom.h                    extends interpreter
  P/custom.c                    extends interpreter
  P/custom.dispatch             extends interpreter
  P/custom.setl                 high-level package (optional)
  P/whatami                     short one-line description of P

Each package also typically requires an AM_CONDITIONAL line in
../configure.ac to test for the appropriate "--with-*" configure
option.  The resulting conditionals, such as COND_W and COND_MESA,
can then be used in ../run/Makefile.am to determine build flags
and trigger the building and linking of extra libraries into the
setl executable.

P must also be listed in SUBDIRS in Makefile.am, and P/Makefile goes
in the arg to AC_CONFIG_FILES in configure.ac, to make P available.

See also existing examples w (bare-bones, "manually" generated
customization code) and mesa (a fine example of spam data processing).
