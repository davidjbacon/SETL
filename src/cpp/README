This is based on the cpplib-based version of the GNU C Preprocessor (CPP)
distributed with GCC 2.7.2.1.  It removes the undocumented "-lang-chill"
support, which was manifestly broken, fixes a minor bug in the C++
support, and adds "-lang-setl" in such a way that it should be compatible
with pretty well every other option within reason.

A coeval snapshot of the monolithic cpp (cccp.c) is included here but is
not used.  It could be patched after the fashion of cpplib.c if someone
wanted to give it a -lang-setl option.  This is the version the GCC
distribution itself uses by default, and is what the cpplib version
appears to have been hacked from originally.
